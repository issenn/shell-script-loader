------------------
0.2.1 (2018/01/22)
------------------

- getcleanpath functions now use simpler word splitting wih filename
  expansion temporarily disabled.  This avoids internal use of temporary
  files and pipes.  All versions of bash now only use one version of
  getcleanpath thanks to it.  Ksh variants also now only use two.

  The generic version has also been enhanced and no longer requires a
  subfunction summoned in a subshell.

- Local variables now use lowercase characters.

----------------
0.2 (2016/06/28)
----------------

- Function calls are now less recursive by one level.

- Now using getcleanpath instead of getabspath.  It is simpler, and we
  don't need the strict features of getabspath.

- Added loader.bash-4 which strictly supports Bash version 4.0 and
  above.

- Also added loader-include-prototype.bash.

- Added support for MirBSD Ksh.

- Now using hash to remember location of executable binaries in some
  places that are applicable and helpful to improve performance without
  being completely explicit about the path.

- Reformatted messages to more proper case form.

- Reformatted changelog file.

- Some non-critical fixes.

- It's a complete code overhaul.

------------------
0.1.2 (2016/06/22)
------------------

- Fixed instances of `\"$__\"` which should be `\"\$__\"`.  It caused
  some scripts to be seen as not readable and not load when 'loader.sh'
  is loaded with advanced shells like Bash and Zsh.

- All advanced shell functions now use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` for
  consistency.

- Simplified `[ ! ... ] &&` to `[ ... ] ||` in a getabspath function.

- We now check LOADER_CS_I if it's still set and has value > 0 before
  unsetting the element in LOADER_CS since Zsh gives an error if it's no
  longer set.  It happens when loader_finish is called in a called
  script.

- Now using "${!VAR_@}" instead of IFS=' ' and ${!VAR_*}.

- Now using 'printf' instead of 'echo' in a 'for' loop when applicable.

------------------
0.1.1 (2011/07/14)
------------------

- Added this changelog.

- Added an internal function for getting absolute paths in the generic
  script loader-extended.sh.  Normal shells are now independent of the
  external commands getabspath and awk.

- Fixed detection of the optional external command getabspath.  This
  time also, it will only be used if the newly added internal function
  doesn't work for the shell.

- No changes were made in other scripts.

----------------
0.1 (2011/04/09)
----------------

- First presentable release.
